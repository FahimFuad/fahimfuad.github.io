      <description>Got a dream down today, finally. I lowkey expected talentpool, which started from 1190(approximately), I got 1184 :)
But hey, 048th in general is not bad, 1st from Joseph EV ‚úåÔ∏è
I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be content with this, but I am happy because I achieved all these 100% by myself, had none to help around me during exams, I was the G there.
Guess I should write more stuff here instead of threads, that thing sucks</description>

      <title>BUP Drill</title>

      <description>BUP was a nice experience, cantonment is nice, the environment was nice. Question standard was pretty okay even though I was not able to unleash my full potential there, 250 seats for 20K in FST, pretty hard. My brain was vibing on One Kiss by Dua Lipa during the exam, so that&amp;rsquo;s cool too.
My preparation for BUP:
Beef House burger loaded with mushroom and BBQ sauce from Burger Express, worked out pretty well.</description>

      <description>People don&amp;rsquo;t value love, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can&amp;rsquo;t replace me. The days when I will become the richest man on my blood-line are hopefully near, I mean I already started a company which is undercover, I am in dreams of changing this country, sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person(questionable), who doesn&amp;rsquo;t even value if I die?</description>

      <description>In previous post I discussed about the pointers in C++ which is pretty cringe and noob topic. So I will be like normal Ridhwan and jump from noob topic to a highly advanced topic which is used in the game engines like Unreal Engine, C++ hot reloading!
Unlike &amp;lsquo;C#&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;lua&amp;rsquo; C++ is not often used as a scripting language. Unreal Engine does that somehow &amp;amp; I have no idea how they do that.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was eating snacks along with my family, it was raining outside the weather was chill. Suddenly my Queen told me that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very lucky thing to experience the income of the son. You will buy me a mansion, take me to the Switzerland, buy me a Botique shop at Bailey Road&amp;rdquo;
At first I was enjoying the conversation, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know what your mother needs from you.</description>

      <description>Pointers in C/C++Link to headingBefore starting I wanna clarify that, I always wanted to share my knowledge of C++, there are some things in C++ that beginners find hard to catch as it is different from other languages. C++ is a VERY powerful, the fastest programming language to ever exist till now. (To a lot of people it is the hardest language to learn due to it&amp;rsquo;s complexity).</description>

      <description>The Perks of Being a Wallflower (Drama/Romance) 8/10Link to headingYou can call this movie a &amp;ldquo;GoodWatch~ish&amp;rdquo;.
Firstly, I don&amp;rsquo;t watch romance genre, but some quotes from these movie attaracted me, and say what- It was worth it
This movie is based on a high school dickhead idiot falling in love with his senior (Pretty cringe, but I will allow it because Emma Watson was there). There is a song &amp;ldquo;Could it be another change&amp;rdquo; that I absolutely loved!</description>

      <description>Uncharted (Adventure/Action): 6.5/10Link to headingYou can proudly call this movie a quater-shit.
So watched this movie last night, not a big fan of Adventure/Action genre but this movie was good enough. Basically my friend who is unfortunately taller than Tom Holland hit me up to watch this movie.
I liked the minor details in this movie which you can completely miss if you don&amp;rsquo;t watch carefully. Other than that the ending was not upto the mark, I thought of some sorta ending relationship between the Gold Seekers, that would&amp;rsquo;ve been fun to watch.</description>

      <description>So, I finally completed my HSC, hopefully I will pass a with a good marks with my friends. I always thought that finishing HSC will be a blast and enjoyable, but everything feels so vague. ACS classes are long &amp;amp; tiresome to do, but I got no other option at this moment.
The last time I felt these vagueness and identity crisis was not good. I was rejected, rejected from my dream college while my friends got accepted.</description>
