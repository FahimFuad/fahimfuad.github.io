      <description>Heye it&amp;rsquo;s me Fahim Fuad. You know me, else you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be here. Everyday I wake up, do what I can and capable to do, watch Facebook reels(Okay it is a joke, 99% of the time I never watch reels alone, short videos destroys your focus, useless dopamin leaks) and write shits here, sleep and repeat.&#xA;Jokes apart, I am a game engine and graphics programmer from Bangladesh, I ace in Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX11 rendering APIs, in physics engines I&amp;rsquo;ve used PhysX by NVIDIA.</description>

It is: &amp;ldquo;বাঙালি Monica Geller এর আশায় Chandler Bing হয়ে দাড়িয়ে আছি।&amp;rdquo; Bro he loved it!</description>
