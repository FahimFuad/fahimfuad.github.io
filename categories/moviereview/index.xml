      <description>Uncharted (Adventure/Action): 6.5/10Link to headingYou can proudly call this movie a quater-shit.
So watched this movie last night, not a big fan of Adventure/Action genre but this movie was good enough. Basically my friend who is unfortunately taller than Tom Holland hit me up to watch this movie.
I liked the minor details in this movie which you can completely miss if you don&amp;rsquo;t watch carefully. Other than that the ending was not upto the mark, I thought of some sorta ending relationship between the Gold Seekers, that would&amp;rsquo;ve been fun to watch.</description>
