        <p><em>I am making a new category called &lsquo;Life&rsquo; to post my documentation/memory shits. Some of the previous posts are moved into this category.</em>

<p>So today was my mother&rsquo;s birthday. It feels bad as I am running out of time slowly. Her higher secondary level&rsquo;s friend came over today with a surprise cake. I was not expecting that
from her friend, but it was nice. I gave away my concept books to Her friends kid as I have the real ones now. What else, we spent a good time cutting the cake in the first half of the day.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Later in the day, my mother hit up <em>my sister&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s mother</em> (yeah complicated) for a Pizza treat. &ldquo;Somehow&rdquo; my sister&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s sibling became my close-ish friend during hard times.
I met them for the first time today, and man, I felt awkward &amp; low for some reason. I became newly &ldquo;close&rdquo; to them during my HSC time, so close that we used to do study/ooga-booga rants for hours after hours.
Meeting them for the first time was nice, I agree, really agree. Honestly speaking they kept my HSC spirit going, I am thankful to them by my life. It&rsquo;s not like that I am alone without friends, but during
my HSC time they <em>were</em> by my side, <em>unknowingly</em> helping me to keep my study going after that big <em>strike</em>. For some reason I enjoyed talking with them just like I enjoyed taking with my other homies.
So, HSC ended soon and we used to rant normally, but things changed suddently and they were vanished. I am not used to with vanishing homie like that so I thought that I did something wrong. At the time of writing
this, I still think that I did something wrong, but ok, I apologized from my part. They say that there is a reason which is not relevant to me, I truly believe that and I kinda guessed the reason with my
6th sense.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Why I am thinking that I did something wrong? -&gt; Honestly I don&rsquo;t know, it just doesn&rsquo;t feel right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe I am a maniac or a overcare-ing shit to my friends. I can&rsquo;t change.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why they <em>are</em> here in this post, I mean in my mother&rsquo;s birthday related post WTF?
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<ul>
<li>Because I felt low today due to the behaviour and talks I did with them in the past. What talk? Ridhwan knows that, you don&rsquo;t have to. I really don&rsquo;t hate them or <em>like</em> them, but I really
digged the personality and mind. There were some things between me and them that scarred me for my life &amp; we have a lot in common, that&rsquo;s why they are &ldquo;special&rdquo; to me, and I care for them.
To tell the truth, I missed the study rants and company, it was fun.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></li>
</ul>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if I should lock up these type of Life documentations, maybe soon. I am lazy to do that because only my school friends(Hello idiot, I want zero question about this post on GC)
know about this site xD.</p>
<p>This low feeling is something I want to capture for the future. So yeah, hooking this up here for the time being.
I won&rsquo;t thank you for reading this post, because I feel low. ðŸ‘Š</p>
