People don&rsquo;t value admiration, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can&rsquo;t replace you. I am in a journey of changing the tech industry of Bangladesh and sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person(questionable maybe), who doesn&rsquo;t even value if I die? Seriously? Damn that hurts.
Listen well brothers, never run for girls, NEVER.">

<p>People don&rsquo;t value admiration, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can&rsquo;t replace you. I am in a journey of changing the tech industry of Bangladesh and sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person(questionable maybe), who doesn&rsquo;t even value if I die? Seriously? Damn that hurts.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Listen well brothers, never run for girls, NEVER. 90% of the girls are just after your looks and money, none sees the inner YOU. Build yourself first, then girls are like an added bonus. As they say, don&rsquo;t chase butterflies, make a garden instead.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So did I chase her? No, I just expressed how I felt to her, really frankly. I don&rsquo;t mind the rejection, not at all. But losing a person &amp; ending on bad terms and misunderstanding pokes me, she thinks me as possesive and &ldquo;MrRight&rdquo; kinda person. Understandable because I try to speak straight to the point, without any sugarcoating, with everyone. Also she thinks that she is the only girl I have talked too xD. That happens when you have really less face to face interaction.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>For some reason I know that she felt the same and I am right &amp; sure about this, over 100%. But she thinks she can&rsquo;t take the rejection back, so there is nothing I can do. As I said, I mistimes stuff.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I lov<strong>ed</strong> someone who didn&rsquo;t value my existance? I offered frienship to her, she denied that too, I have no problem with that, I lost nothing, wait, I actually I lost someone whom I admired the existance of. She lost someone which maybe she regrets, bet? That&rsquo;s good. If she can&rsquo;t compromise her ego then dumping her ass and leaving is the only option. I still don&rsquo;t get why she is acting like that, I mean that&rsquo;s not normal behaviour&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I regret the butterfly effect? NO, NOT AT ALL.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>My miss used to say this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you end up on bad terms with someone that doesn&rsquo;t mean the journey itself was wasteful. The time you spent was good for both which you should cherish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I showed her my good side only, my dark side still remains intact, everyone has a dark side. Even with my dark side &amp; even after getting hurt a lot by her words, I can&rsquo;t wish her something bad or unluck, It doesn&rsquo;t feel right to me. I want to forge the hate but&hellip;</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I remember her without any reason at unexpected times. I have no hopes of fixing this complicated relationship with her as I won&rsquo;t reach her out even if we both get into the same Uni, if she reaches out then that&rsquo;s awesome, else this remains as a scar. The problem is this shit pokes me, for example right now it&rsquo;s poking me. Scar indeed, which I have no way to fix.</p>
