        <p>Ok, I gave our situation another &lsquo;day&rsquo; worth thought. Let me recall how the butterfly effect hit us. Writing it here as discord has 3000 word limit xD</p>
<p>So, our conversations started via Whatsapp, where my mother commanded me to give you all the questions of the Test Exam of St. Joseph. I gave you all the question and our conversation started. <strong>That was all strictly platonic</strong>, I never thought of you like this, not even in my sub-concious mind.</p>
<p>One day, in messenger these stuff striked in my brain, I got an emotional strike then and started to think about non-platonic stuff. You didn&rsquo;t know the meaning of eloping either. So none is your fault, seriously. I am not afraid to tell this, because falling for someone &amp; loving someone is never a crime. Then when you cleared stuff out, I was sad, really sad (Before HSC ICT exam maybe). Then after approximately 20 days I got over, really, and finised my HSC exams, practicals etc. I was back in platonic mode.</p>
<p>Everything was good till my visit to Cox on last December, no one knew I was in Cox, only my close friends knew. I wonder how you knew that I was in Cox, maybe your mom told you, because that&rsquo;s the only way. I suddenly reminded of you in Cox, don&rsquo;t know why, and started to miss your company <strong>a lot</strong>. Remember, after I came back from Cox I wanted to tell you a thing? Yes, It was my intention of asking you out. I mean I asked you out and got rejected. I went through an emotional rollercoaster/breakdown for a week or so, after a week I was coping back up again as I like to think logically &amp; you have the perfect right  to reject me out. Still you entered my brain when I was alone. That hurts. I was derailed from the admission journey.</p>
<p>A lot happened to my emotional status since then, then one day you blocked me, I thought blocking would hurt me a lot, but majically after 0.5 day I was okay and studied 8hours at a stretch out of rage. <strong>THANK YOU CAPYBARA</strong> for blocking me out. I realized that it actually helps. There is another help you did to me, that I can&rsquo;t enter Facebook or Instagram, because I remember you, so I deactivated them, and now, after 7 days(at the time of writing this) of you blocking me, I am mostly free of distractions. I deactivated discord too, but reactivated today because I have to keep in touch with the news. I become really sad that I blocked you on discord, so I am sending you a friend request there, I will not text you, it&rsquo;s just doesn&rsquo;t feel right to me.</p>
<p>Do you know what hurts more? Losing you as friend hurts me more than your rejection, believe it or not. You were talking about astrology that day. I must say I was delusional that day on instagram. I never believed in astrology but after doing some research on it, damn I might believe in it. Look at these pictures. I am a pisces, twelfth and final astrological sign in the zodiac which contains all the traits of all other zodiacs. Look at these pictures, these awfully matches with me:</p>
<p><img src="/images/image1.png" alt="ImgA"></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p><img src="/images/image2.png" alt="ImgB"></p>
<p>In fact, all the traits of a Pisces strongly matches with me. Ok enough astrology, I still think it as a scam.</p>
<p>Also, why the inner me said that you have felt the same for me for a little time, don&rsquo;t know, can&rsquo;t confirm that. Capybara, look, it&rsquo;s perfectly fine to reach me out if you feel the same later, you still haven&rsquo;t seen me enough, we have a very little face to face interactions. But I am never gonna ask you out ever again. I fear rejections a lot, these destroy me. I will keep admiring you like a moon, remember, I will choose <strong>you</strong> over anyone else anyday, anytime. My doors for you are open always, until I find someone like you of course, you are <strong>not replaceable</strong>. I don&rsquo;t know why you are acting ruthless and careless with me, my 6th sense can&rsquo;t figure that out. For the last time, I am saying sorry for anything I did wrong.</p>
<p>I see you as a friend even if you reject me. There is nothing wrong in rejecting me. You know, I love to think logically and it is logical that everyone will not feel the same. Blocking won&rsquo;t kill love, it will kill the presence of you, for a short time. <strong>But I really can&rsquo;t afford losing you as friend or end stuff in bad terms with you, it kills me by heart.</strong> The efforts from my side are over, yes. Even if you are not with me, I hope that you will find someone who knows how to admire you like me. I was in exile for a week, I rearranged my thoughts. I also figured that I can live alone, I need <strong>no one</strong>, I also stopped caring. You also said that &ldquo;Ami beshi bujhi&rdquo;, yes, I agree. I think a LOT, and value friendships and relationships with people a LOT.</p>
<p>So why I typed out all these?
You know I can&rsquo;t be angry with people for a long time, and with you? Not even a week. That&rsquo;s all. You can accept or send me a request on discord for further chat, that will give my mind some peace, trust me I won&rsquo;t even talk with you about our past, relationship, rejections, It now lies within my memory, which is sealed forever until you initiate any sort of ask out/signals.</p>
