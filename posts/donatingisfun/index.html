<p>I was outside for some grinding. I was about to buy some stuff then I saw that I had
extra 200 taka on my pocket, I donno maybe I forgot to take it out from my pocket last time I wore this pant, typical me. Then I suddenly saw a beggar(kid), looking at the stuff I bought.
I felt so pity that I wanted to give him some of the foods I had. He kept looking at my stuff. Then my brain suddenly clicked that I had spare 200 taka with me.
I instantly gave away that 200 taka to that kid, the look at his face was worth the giveaway, the happiness I saw in his eyes can&rsquo;t be bought with 200 taka, never.
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>It is astonishing that what you can do with a little amount. As they say, the less you have the more happiness you have, you get satisfied easily. I got a very nice feeling after I helped that
kid. I asked him what he would do with that money(typical me, if I gave away 10 taka or small amount, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask of course). He told me that he will buy some food with that and save the rest.
I was like, &ldquo;mhmm ok, just don&rsquo;t buy or do drugs&rdquo;. Who cares anyways, I digged the smile I got from that kid, IT IS PRICELESS!
<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Ok bye.</p>
