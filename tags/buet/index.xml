      <description>Yesterday I was eating snacks along with my family, it was raining outside the weather was chill. Suddenly my Queen told me that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very lucky thing to experience the income of the son. You will buy me a mansion, take me to the Switzerland, buy me a Botique shop at Bailey Road&amp;rdquo;
At first I was enjoying the conversation, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know what your mother needs from you.</description>

      <description>I used to follow(still follow) 2 seniors from HSC&#39;22 batch (I was enrolled in ACS Engg&#39;22), I won&amp;rsquo;t expose their names here ofcourse. One of the senior(male) got into BUET in under 300 rank, studying with my dream subject CSE. I was happy for that brother. The other senior(female) also got chance in BUET in Architecture department.
As I follow both of them in Facebook, their update comes in my feed.</description>
