      <description>I am making a new category called &amp;lsquo;Life&amp;rsquo; to post my documentation/memory shits. Some of the previous posts are moved into this category. So today was my mother&amp;rsquo;s birthday. It feels bad as I am running out of time slowly. Her higher secondary level&amp;rsquo;s friend came over today with a surprise cake. I was not expecting that from her friend, but it was nice. I gave away my concept books to Her friends kid as I have the real ones now.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was eating snacks along with my family, it was raining outside the weather was chill. Suddenly my Queen told me that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very lucky thing to experience the income of the son. You will buy me a mansion, take me to the Switzerland, buy me a Botique shop at Bailey Road&amp;rdquo;
At first I was enjoying the conversation, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know what your mother needs from you.</description>

      <description>So, I finally completed my HSC, hopefully I will pass a with a good marks with my friends. I always thought that finishing HSC will be a blast and enjoyable, but everything feels so vague. ACS classes are long &amp;amp; tiresome to do, but I got no other option at this moment.
The last time I felt these vagueness and identity crisis was not good. I was rejected, rejected from my dream college while my friends got accepted.</description>
