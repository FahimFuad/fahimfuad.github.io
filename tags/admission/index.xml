      <description>I used to follow(still follow) 2 seniors from HSC&#39;22 batch (I was enrolled in ACS Engg&#39;22), I won&amp;rsquo;t expose their names here ofcourse. One of the senior(male) got into BUET in under 300 rank, studying with my dream subject CSE. I was happy for that brother. The other senior(female) also got chance in BUET in Architecture department.
As I follow both of them in Facebook, their update comes in my feed.</description>

      <description>So, I finally completed my HSC, hopefully I will pass a with a good marks with my friends. I always thought that finishing HSC will be a blast and enjoyable, but everything feels so vague. ACS classes are long &amp;amp; tiresome to do, but I got no other option at this moment.
The last time I felt these vagueness and identity crisis was not good. I was rejected, rejected from my dream college while my friends got accepted.</description>
