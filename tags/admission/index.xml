      <description>A lot happpened since the admission started, and I am on the last month. Time for me to go in full exile, for next one month. After next month, the journey will be over, hopefully next EID will be mine. Praying and practicing for now. Maybe I will be posting updates on RidDiary evey week, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to live alone, without socials, but it will be worth it in the end.</description>

      <title>BUP Fail</title>

      <description>Meh, I expected on waiting list. Am I expecting too much? I mean I studied nothing for BUP, I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t expect a merit. Funny how the 20K fighting for 250 seats, all of my idiot elite homies are rejected too ðŸ˜‚
Bro who is BUP selecting then? Quota idiots? ðŸ˜‚
I know I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t care about BUP, we don&amp;rsquo;t care for BUP, it was more like a tourist exam&amp;hellip;. but it feels sad for some reason even though I didn&amp;rsquo;t prepare for it, getting rejected is tough.</description>

      <description>BUP was a nice experience, cantonment is nice, the environment was nice. Question standard was pretty okay even though I was not able to unleash my full potential there, 250 seats for 20K in FST, pretty hard. My brain was vibing on One Kiss by Dua Lipa during the exam, so that&amp;rsquo;s cool too.
My preparation for BUP:
Beef House burger loaded with mushroom and BBQ sauce from Burger Express, worked out pretty well.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I was eating snacks along with my family, it was raining outside the weather was chill. Suddenly my Queen told me that &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s a very lucky thing to experience the income of the son. You will buy me a mansion, take me to the Switzerland, buy me a Botique shop at Bailey Road&amp;rdquo;
At first I was enjoying the conversation, it&amp;rsquo;s good to know what your mother needs from you.</description>

      <description>So, I finally completed my HSC, hopefully I will pass a with a good marks with my friends. I always thought that finishing HSC will be a blast and enjoyable, but everything feels so vague. ACS classes are long &amp;amp; tiresome to do, but I got no other option at this moment.
The last time I felt these vagueness and identity crisis was not good. I was rejected, rejected from my dream college while my friends got accepted.</description>
