      <description>Ok, I gave our situation another &amp;lsquo;day&amp;rsquo; worth thought. Let me recall how the butterfly effect hit us. Writing it here as discord has 3000 word limit xD
So, our conversations started on 14 March 2022, via Whatsapp, where my mother commanded me to give you all the questions of the Test Exam of St. Joseph. I gave you all the question and our conversation started. That was all strictly platonic, I never thought of you like this, not even in my sub-concious mind.</description>

      <description>In previous post I discussed about the pointers in C++ which is pretty cringe and noob topic. So I will be like normal Ridhwan and jump from noob topic to a highly advanced topic which is used in the game engines like Unreal Engine, C++ hot reloading!
Unlike &amp;lsquo;C#&amp;rsquo;, &amp;rsquo;lua&amp;rsquo; C++ is not often used as a scripting language. Unreal Engine does that somehow &amp;amp; I have no idea how they do that.</description>

      <description>Pointers in C/C++Link to headingBefore starting I wanna clarify that, I always wanted to share my knowledge of C++, there are some things in C++ that beginners find hard to catch as it is different from other languages. C++ is a VERY powerful, the fastest programming language to ever exist till now. (To a lot of people it is the hardest language to learn due to it&amp;rsquo;s complexity).</description>
