Heye it's me Fahim Fuad. You know me, else you wouldn't be here. Everyday I wake up, do what I can and capable to do, watch Facebook reels and write shits here, sleep and repeat.

Jokes apart, I am a game engine and graphics programmer from Bangladesh, I ace in Vulkan, OpenGL, DirectX11 reneding APIs, in physics engines I've used PhysX by NVIDIA. In languages, I speak C, C++, C#. Also yes, I hate Python because it's shit, pure dogshit.
