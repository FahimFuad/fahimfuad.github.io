So, I finally completed my HSC, hopefully I will pass a with a good marks with my friends. I always thought that finishing HSC will be a blast and enjoyable, but everything feels so vague.<br>
ACS classes are long & tiresome to do, but I got no other option at this moment.<br>

The last time I felt these vagueness and identity crisis was not good. I was rejected, rejected from my dream college while my friends got accepted. I was left alone. This is the same feeling~ <br>

Weekly of ACS are also starting, no idea how will I attend all these because I am in a denial from study. Friends are away, enjoying the tours, except two of them.<br>
And me? My chances of going somewhere are low because of my parents are busy, but there is a hope.<br>
Why are you even reading these shit? Go away.<br>

Maybe, maybeee~~ this is the start of my Admission Journey - The last run.<br>
This start is full of denial and vagueness, which I totally didn't expect.<br>
