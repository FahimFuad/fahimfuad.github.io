The problem with us is not the problem actually. If the syllabus is 70%, but the time is 50%, how are they expecting us to complete everything in such a short time including lab reports?
Why, I mean why? Why do the students always have to suffer in our country every time some unwanted circumstances happen? Why are we always being targeted? After all this, in admission tests,
the demands would be sky high. Not to mention some college authorities forcing continuous exams after not even completing the given syllabus. They want us to improve our extra curricular
skills by destroying our curricular comfort. Some people are bound to do better everywhere. But what about general students? Don't they deserve happiness and a sigh of relief? Don't they
deserve a chance to study in prestigious institutions? According to our country, I don't think so.
