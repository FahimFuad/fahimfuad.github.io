BUP was a nice experience, cantonment is nice, the environment was nice. Question standard was pretty okay even though I was not able to unleash my full potential there, 250 seats for 20K in FST, pretty hard. My brain was vibing on One Kiss by Dua Lipa during the exam, so that's cool too.


My preparation for BUP:
- Beef House burger loaded with mushroom and BBQ sauce from Burger Express, worked out pretty well.
