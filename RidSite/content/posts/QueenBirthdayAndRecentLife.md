*I am making a new category called 'Life' to post my documentation/memory shits. Some of the previous posts are moved into this category.*
<br>

So today was my mother's birthday. It feels bad as I am running out of time slowly. Her higher secondary level's friend came over today with a surprise cake. I was not expecting that
from her friend, but it was nice. I gave away my concept books to Her friends kid as I have the real ones now. What else, we spent a good time cutting the cake in the first half of the day.
<br>

Later in the day, my mother hit up *my sister's friend's mother* (yeah complicated) for a Pizza treat. "Somehow" my sister's friend's sibling became my close-ish friend during hard times.
I met them for the first time today, and man, I felt awkward & low for some reason. I became newly "close" to them during my HSC time, so close that we used to do study/ooga-booga rants for hours after hours.
Meeting them for the first time was nice, I agree, really agree. Honestly speaking they kept my HSC spirit going, I am thankful to them by my life. It's not like that I am alone without friends, but during
my HSC time they *were* by my side, *unknowingly* helping me to keep my study going after that big *strike*. For some reason I enjoyed talking with them just like I enjoyed taking with my other homies.
So, HSC ended soon and we used to rant normally, but things changed suddently and they were vanished. I am not used to with vanishing homie like that so I thought that I did something wrong. At the time of writing
this, I still think that I did something wrong, but ok, I apologized from my part. They say that there is a reason which is not relevant to me, I truly believe that and I kinda guessed the reason with my
6th sense.
<br>

Why I am thinking that I did something wrong? -> Honestly I don't know, it just doesn't feel right.
> Maybe I am a maniac or a overcare-ing shit to my friends. I can't change.
<br>

So why they *are* here in this post, I mean in my mother's birthday related post WTF?
<br>

- Because I felt low today due to the behaviour and talks I did with them in the past. What talk? Ridhwan knows that, you don't have to. I really don't hate them or *like* them, but I really
digged the personality and mind. There were some things between me and them that scarred me for my life & we have a lot in common, that's why they are "special" to me, and I care for them. 
To tell the truth, I missed the study rants and company, it was fun.
<br>

Don't know if I should lock up these type of Life documentations, maybe soon. I am lazy to do that because only my school friends(Hello idiot, I want zero question about this post on GC)
know about this site xD.

This low feeling is something I want to capture for the future. So yeah, hooking this up here for the time being.
I won't thank you for reading this post, because I feel low. 👊
