25 days left till exams, and here I am wasting my time here. Feeling really depressed and sad today, feels like "কোথাও chance পামু না", legit this is how I feel right now. I used to be so much confident. It will be a good idea to disassemble my PC, and be a cave man. Yeah, imma disassemble my PC tonight, so this is my last time spending time on this site, I will be back with a post after exams.

What I think is the key to admission is "পারা জিনিস ভুল না করা" and "কঠিন জিনিস পইরা লাভ নাই", you know 100+ formulas of PCM combined, you have to write integration and organic together...

<br>

I still got a ton revision left... will apply "যতক্ষণ সজাগ ততক্ষণ পড়াশোনা"

If any admission candidate is reading this(According to my previous "Reader Test", I have zero readers xD), here are some useful stuff for you:

1. "Alarmy" App, will get the shit out of your sleep, works for a dead deep sleeper like me.\
2. Pomodoro App\
3. This one is my focus technique, during study breaks stare at walls and do something boring. Your brain will crave hardwork. ;)\
4. Don't do ACS English + Physics Recap classes, they are dogshit

<br>

It has been fun developing this site and writing stuff up.

**Bye!**
