I will buy this book no matter what. Jokes apart, this is a magnificent source of recreaction. I wonder how that girl is with that old man, money? Bruh, for money? Most likley that old man suffers from erectile dysfunction, I mean I have seen them a lot long ago they were hidden, but this... they are public now. I just want to know how in the world that lady is with that old man, I want to know the psychology behind this, for money is a cheap answer, that girl looks so happy...\
I WANT TO KNOW HOW SHE IS SO HAPPY...

<br>

This girl claims that she is beautiful, what the fuck...

# IELC:

My homies are IELC freaks, but I have never been a fan of IELC, but "My পীর Anus" is coming at ISC. Intrigued and concerned(slightly) at the same time. If you don't know who "My পীর Anus" is then you should not exist. Homies left IELC panels long ago, I see this club has turned into a complete joke now. Learn something from ISTARC, they bring Apar Bhai, and you all bring shits.
