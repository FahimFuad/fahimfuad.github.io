## Uncharted (Adventure/Action): 6.5/10

You can proudly call this movie a quater-shit.<br>

So watched this movie last night, not a big fan of Adventure/Action genre but this movie was good enough.
Basically my friend who is unfortunately taller than Tom Holland hit me up to watch this movie.

I liked the minor details in this movie which you can completely miss if you don't watch carefully. Other than that
the ending was not upto the mark, I thought of some sorta ending relationship between the Gold Seekers, that would've been fun
to watch. 😛

Not a complete waste of time, recommended if you have a LOT of time.
Ok now I ran out of lines to write, don't wanna give any more spoilers<br>

Thank you for reading this shit, you are AWESOME. 💙
