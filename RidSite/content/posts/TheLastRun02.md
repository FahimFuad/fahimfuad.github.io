A lot happpened since the admission started, and I am on the last month. Time for me to go in full exile, for next one month. After next month, the journey will be over, hopefully next EID will be mine. Praying and practicing for now. Maybe I will be posting updates on RidDiary evey week, it's hard to live alone, without socials, but it will be worth it in the end. Hope so.

And, yes, Rid failed to kill love. I realized it still exists within me, and that's the reason I can't say something hurtful to her, even in her abscence. But I will never approach her ever again by myself because my self respect comes first, already made a mistake making the first move and by being frank. People start to think that they are the all you have if you give them value, in reality it's not the case. Actually if I give this a second thought, she did a fantastic thing rejecting me as admission time is not the time for this. I realized this at the start of this year. I should hate her for her words but the hate doesn't come for her. Nah, I can't hate her.

<br>

Another major thing happened inbetween is my friend's breakup. I should be sad but I am happy because she left her. That low IQ instagram star doesn't deserve my elite friend. I always say to go for brain, not looks, but who listens my words regarding these. As I said, if you actually admire someone, breakup is not an option.

<br>

Do you know what's attractive chico? Intelligence. Intelligence is the most attractive thing, not the looks. People these days can't think straight, and if she is a Instagram star with *1K+* followers the brain is more doomed. Yes, sure you **can** and **should** use Instagram and Facebook sharing your life, but chasing boys/girls via insta, snapchat(Facebook is not used because people get exposed ðŸ˜‚) is the cheapest way possible. I mean, what the fuck? Get a life man. I really want to write a long hate speech here targeting these people but I don't have time ðŸ˜›... Shit man, making this site is getting addictive...

<br>

I am not a misogynist nor a feminist, but if writing a hate speech towards these type of people makes me misogynist, then so be it.

<br>

Anyeays, hopefully reading all these after 2 months will be worth it. Will be managing my leisure by shitposting on my website (RidDiary section), let's see if I can hit 12hours per day.
