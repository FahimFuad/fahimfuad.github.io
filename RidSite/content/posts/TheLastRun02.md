A lot happpened since the admission started, and I am on the last month. Time for me to go in full exile, for next one month. After next month, the journey will be over, hopefully next EID will be mine. Praying and practicing for now. Maybe I will be posting updates on RidDiary evey week, it's hard to live alone, without socials, but it will be worth it in the end. Hope so.

And yes, Rid failed to kill love. I realized it still exists within me, and that's the reason I can't say something hurtful to her, even in her abscence. But I will never approach ever her again by myself because my self respect comes first, already made a mistake making the first move and by being frank. People start to think that they are the all you have if you give them value, in reality it's not the case. Actually if I give this a second thought, she did a good thing rejecting me as admission time is not the time for this. I realized this on the start of this year.

Do you know what's attractive chico? Intelligence. Intelligence is the most attractive thing, not the looks. People these days can't think straight, their brain is fucked by distractions, reels. I really want to write a hate speech here targeting these peoples but I don't have time ðŸ˜›

Hopefully reading all these after 2 months will be worth it. Will be managing my leisure by shitposting on my website (RidDiary section), let's see if I can hit 12hours per day.
