Hey little brain & little IQ(probably negative IQ) entity,
<br>
Here I will list all the Notes of my Engineering Entrance Preparation:
Links will be updated chapterwise. Why I am making all this public? Well there are two reasons, one is I want to keep an online PDF in case I lose my orginal copy, and second one is
"If you love something, set it free". Oh shit কবি হয়ে গেলাম। Anyways, here are the notes, enjoy!

(I will upload the links to the PDF gradually)
