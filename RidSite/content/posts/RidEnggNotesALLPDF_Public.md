Hey little brain & little IQ(probably negative IQ) entity
<br>

Here I will list all the Notes of my Engineering Entrance Preparation. Links will be updated chapterwise. Why I am making all these public? Well there are two reasons, one is I want to keep an online PDF in case I lose my orginal copy, and second one is
"If you love something, set it free". Oh shit কবি হয়ে গেলাম। Anyways, here are the notes, enjoy!
<br>

(I will upload the links to the PDF gradually as I create them)
