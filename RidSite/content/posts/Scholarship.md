Got a dream down today, finally. I lowkey expected talentpool, which started from 1190(approximately), I got 1184 :)

<br>

But hey, 048th in general is not bad, 1st from Joseph EV ‚úåÔ∏è, 3rd from Whole Joseph 

<br>

AND

<br>

**162th in Dhaka Board!**

<br>

Man it feels so good to fulfill promises, I promised my queen of this, made it and she was like "‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶∏ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶≤‡ßá, ‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶≤‡ßã‡¶á", this is not a complement, got none but hey, I know She is really happy inside. üëÄ

<br>


I shouldn't be content with this, but I am happy because I achieved all these 100% by myself, had none to help around me during exams, I was the G there.

<br>

Guess I should write more stuff here instead of threads, that thing sucks
