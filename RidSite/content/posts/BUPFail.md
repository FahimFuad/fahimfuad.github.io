Meh, I expected on waiting list. Am I expecting too much? I mean I studied nothing for BUP, I shouldn't expect a merit. Funny how the 20K fighting for 250 seats, all of my idiot elite homies are rejected too 😂

<br>

Bro who is BUP selecting then? Quota idiots? 😂

<br>

I know I shouldn't care about BUP, we don't care for BUP, it was more like a tourist exam.... but it fees sad for some reason even though I didn't prepare for it, getting rejected is tough.


Waiting for the people to say

> BUP  তে পাইলা না, BUET এ কেমনে পাইবা?

> Board scholarship পাওয়ার পর তো আকাশে উরতাসস
