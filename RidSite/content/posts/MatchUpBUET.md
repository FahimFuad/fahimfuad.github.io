I used to follow(still follow) 2 seniors from HSC'22 batch (I was enrolled in ACS Engg'22), I won't expose their names here ofcourse.
One of the senior(male) got into BUET in under 300 rank, studying with my dream subject CSE. I was happy for that brother. The other senior(female) also got chance in BUET in
Architecture department.<br>

As I follow both of them in Facebook, their update comes in my feed. They changed their profile picture together, at 9PM. Interestingly, both change of profile picture
came in my feed one after another. First came the big brother's post, with caption "শহর জুড়ে শরৎ,  আর.." and then came the big sister's post with caption "..আর শরৎ জুড়ে তুমি।".<br>

I don't know why I was so damned at this. It was EPIC! People were flooding the comment section and what not. I never thought of this matchup but damn, it's so cool to let people know
of the loved ones in style, people who care will notice afterall.<br>

I never thought of relationship as motivation for BUET because it sounds rubbish. BUET can't get you your partner, it all lies in understanding.
But this, this is something. This is suffering from success. This is something which is possible.<br>

So am I taking this as a motivation?
- Simple answer: NO
Why?
- Because NO
What NO?
- Ok maybe yes? Time will tell... But this is something, something I will remember for a long time.

So why I am writing this here?
- Don't know, I just want to capture the feeling I guess. It's my shitposting website afterall, what are you doing here?
