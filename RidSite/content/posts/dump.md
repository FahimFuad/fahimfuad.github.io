I wish I could replace threads and make this site so customizeable that I could change colors, run music in background, run custom HTML snippets et cetera.... I can do that but I'm too lazy(Actually, no I've got other things to do) :/

This is where I dump memories, anything. Acts like The Pensieve of Albus.

*One simply siphons the excess thoughts from one's mind, pours them into the basin, and examines them at one's leisure. It becomes easier to spot patterns and links, you understand, when they are in this form*
