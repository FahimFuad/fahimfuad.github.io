Yesterday I was eating snacks along with my family, it was raining outside the weather was chill. Suddenly my Queen told me that 
<br>

> "It's a very lucky thing to experience the income of the son. You will buy me a mansion, take me to the Switzerland, buy me a Botique shop at Bailey Road"

At first I was enjoying the conversation, it's good to know what your mother needs from you. But after some time I was struck by reality that I am now a HSC elapsed student,
who got no institutional uniform, no identity. So that means my family will be expecting income from me soon and I have to lead the source along with my father? Duh, I am kid, how will I
do all that 😭
<br>

Time passed so fast that I didn't realize that I am a grown up boy now, people are expecting something from me and here I am writing this shit. Maybe I will income a lot when I get into 
reputed Uni, but for now I really don't care, shouldn't care. The pressure of expection is real bad, really bad. I costed me my dream college and I learnt a good lesson from it. People
starts panic when there are expectations on them, experienced that. My mother shows outside that she never expects something from me but, hell, I read minds. She wants.
<br>

This website is turning into my day to day documentation diary WTF. Hopefully it will be fun to watch & read these stuff in the future. Writing these in my breaks of study, and I got
no topic to write on next xD. Maybe I will cook up some made up stories. Why are you wasting your time reading this? 👊
<br>

Thank you for reading anyways.
