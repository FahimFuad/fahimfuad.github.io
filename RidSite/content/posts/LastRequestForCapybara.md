Ok, I gave our situation another 'day' worth thought. Let me recall how the butterfly effect hit us. Writing it here as discord has 3000 word limit xD

So, our conversations started on 14 March 2022, via Whatsapp, where my mother commanded me to give you all the questions of the Test Exam of St. Joseph. I gave you all the question and our conversation started. **That was all strictly platonic**, I never thought of you like this, not even in my sub-concious mind.

One day, in messenger these stuff striked in my brain, I got an emotional strike then and started to think about non-platonic stuff. You didn't know the meaning of eloping either. So none is your fault, seriously. I am not afraid to tell this, because falling for someone & loving someone is never a crime. Then when you cleared stuff out, I was sad, really sad (Before HSC ICT exam maybe). Then after approximately 20 days I got over, really, and finised my HSC exams, practicals etc. I was back in platonic mode.

Everything was good till my visit to Cox on last December, no one knew I was in Cox, only my close friends knew. I wonder how you knew that I was in Cox, maybe your mom told you, because that's the only way. I suddenly reminded of you in Cox, don't know why, and started to miss your company **a lot**. Remember, after I came back from Cox I wanted to tell you a thing? Yes, It was my intention of asking you out. I mean I asked you out and got rejected. I went through an emotional rollercoaster/breakdown for a week or so, after a week I was coping back up again as I like to think logically & you have the perfect right  to reject me out. Still you entered my brain when I was alone. That hurts. I was derailed from the admission journey.

A lot happened to my emotional status since then, then one day you blocked me, I thought blocking would hurt me a lot, but majically after 0.5 day I was okay and studied 8hours at a stretch out of rage. **THANK YOU CAPYBARA** for blocking me out. I realized that it actually helps. There is another help you did to me, that I can't enter Facebook or Instagram, because I remember you, so I deactivated them, and now, after 7 days(at the time of writing this) of you blocking me, I am mostly free of distractions. I deactivated discord too, but reactivated today because I have to keep in touch with the news. I become really sad that I blocked you on discord, so I am sending you a friend request there, I will not text you, it's just doesn't feel right to me.

Do you know what hurts more? Losing you as friend hurts me more than your rejection, believe it or not. You were talking about astrology that day. I must say I was delusional that day on instagram. I never believed in astrology but after doing some research on it, damn I might believe in it. Look at these pictures. I am a pisces, twelfth and final astrological sign in the zodiac which contains all the traits of all other zodiacs. Look at these pictures, these awfully matches with me:

In fact, all the traits of a Pisces strongly matches with me. Ok enough astrology, I still think it as a scam.

Also, why the inner me said that you have felt the same for me for a little time, don't know, can't confirm that. Capybara, look, it's perfectly fine to reach me out if you feel the same later, you still haven't seen me enough, we have a very little face to face interactions. But I am never gonna ask you out ever again. I fear rejections a lot, these destroy me. I will keep admiring you like a moon, remember, I will choose **you** over anyone else anyday, anytime. My doors for you are open always, until I find someone like you of course, you are **not replaceable**. I don't know why you are acting ruthless and careless with me, my 6th sense can't figure that out. For the last time, I am saying sorry for anything I did wrong.

I see you as a friend even if you reject me. There is nothing wrong in rejecting me. You know, I love to think logically and it is logical that everyone will not feel the same. Blocking won't kill love, it will kill the presence of you, for a short time. **But I really can't afford losing you as friend or end stuff in bad terms with you, it kills me by heart.** The efforts from my side are over, yes. Even if you are not with me, I hope that you will find someone who knows how to admire you like me. I was in exile for a week, I rearranged my thoughts. I also figured that I can live alone, I need **no one**, I also stopped caring. You also said that "Ami beshi bujhi", yes, I agree. I think a LOT, and value friendships and relationships with people a LOT.

So why I typed out all these?
You know I can't be angry with people for a long time, and with you? Not even a week. That's all. You can accept or send me a request on discord for further chat, that will give my mind some peace, trust me I won't even talk with you about our past, relationship, rejections, It now lies within my memory, which is sealed forever until you initiate any sort of ask out/signals.
