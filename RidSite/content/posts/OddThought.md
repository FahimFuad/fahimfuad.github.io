So I got no socials now, I talk with one person in Whatsapp, very limited. So I basically use this site to dump my progress and thoughts & I scroll youtube(can't deactivate that lmao). I usually go through the recommendations and suddenly I saw that MF Joey from Friends series on my recommendation. Clicked on that link, man I want to watch friends now. Binged like 10 clips from the recommendation on Friends, I love it now. Should've watched friends earlier, I aim to watch it soon, after exams, during Ramadan.

<br>

But that's not the thing, thing is Friends reminded me of Her again now(1:30AM), and flashbacked all the stuff. Man my memory is so deep. I lowkey want to fix stuff with Her even if I am hurt a lot by Her words... I mean a person can't be that ruthless, my guess is that she **choose** to act like that...

<br>

Nah can't do that, I do not have the guts nor I have the respect, my self respect is very volatile to her.


<br>

Anyways, why are you reading my shits here? Get a life. I don't know if anyone is reading all these stuff, I didn't make my links public. But hey, if you are reading this, send me a message writing "porsi" or somethng at [NGL](https://ngl.link/ridhwan.dll). I really want to know if someone is reading all these or not...
