So it's my birthday month, turning 20 damn...

>Wait Rid, your birthday is on March 01, no?

No you idiot. To say the truth, my birthday is a total lie for the world, my birthday is on 29 February, 2004, yeah in a leap year. Actually you can say it as 1st March as it's 5 mins past 12, but no. Hopefully this year's gonna be a blast, I aim to visit ThePalace with my **own money** by the end of this year, this time I will stay on the cottage, not on that damn tower.
