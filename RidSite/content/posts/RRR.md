People don't value love, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can't replace me. The days when I will become the richest man on my blood-line are hopefully near, I mean I already started a company which is undercover, I am in dreams of changing this country, sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person(questionable), who doesn't even value if I die? Seriously?

<br>

I lov**ed** someone who didn't value my existance? I have no options. I offered frienship to her, she denied that too, I have no problem with that, I lost nothing, she lost someone which she regrets, I can bet on that. That's good. If she can't compromise her ego then dumping her ass is the only option.

Listen well brothers, never run for girls, NEVER. 90% of the girls are just after your looks and money, none sees the inner YOU. Build yourself first, then girls are an added bonus. I mean I got asked out by a girl out of nowhere, you have high chances.

<br>

So I regret the butterfly effect? NO, NOT AT ALL.

<br>

My miss used to say this:

>If you end up on bad terms with someone that doesn't mean the journey itself was wasteful. The time you spent was good for both which you should cherish.

Exactly. Another one from my great bangla teacher:

>কাউকে দেখে যদি তার উপর ঝাপিয়ে পরতে মনে চায় তাহলে সেটা attraction, love না। এর জন্য মনের মিল থাকতে হয়,পারস্পরিক বোঝাপোরা থাকতে হয় যদিও সে হয়তোবা ততটা সুন্দর নয়-

<br>

Can confirm that mine ***was*** love.

<br>

Funnily I showed her my good side only, my dark side still remains intact. So that's good. Infact who knows my dark side? Only one person. Nothing new about that. Time for me to go in exile. Got dreams to chase.
