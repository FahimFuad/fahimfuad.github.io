People don't value admiration, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can't replace you. I am in a journey of changing the tech industry of Bangladesh and sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person(questionable maybe), who doesn't even value if I die? Seriously? Damn that hurts.

<br>

Listen well brothers, never run for girls, NEVER. 90% of the girls are just after your looks and money, none sees the inner YOU. Build yourself first, then girls are like an added bonus. As they say, don't chase butterflies, make a garden instead.

<br>

So did I chase her? No, I just expressed how I felt to her, really frankly. I don't mind the rejection, not at all. But losing a person & ending on bad terms and misunderstanding pokes me, she thinks me as possesive and "MrRight" kinda person. Understandable because I try to speak straight to the point, without any sugarcoating, with everyone. Also she thinks that she is the only girl I have talked to xD. That happens when you have really less face to face interaction.

<br>

For some reason I know that she felt the same and I am right & sure about this, over 100%. But she thinks she can't take the rejection back, so there is nothing I can do. As I said, I mistimed stuff.

<br>

I lov**ed** someone who didn't value my existance? I offered frienship to her, she denied that too, I have no problem with that, I lost nothing, wait, I actually lost someone whom I admired the existance of. She lost someone which maybe she regrets, bet? That's good. If she can't compromise her ego then dumping her ass and leaving is the only option. I still don't get why she is acting like that, I mean that's not normal behaviour...

<br>

So I regret the butterfly effect? NO, NOT AT ALL.

<br>

My miss used to say this:

>If you end up on bad terms with someone that doesn't mean the journey itself was wasteful. The time you spent was good for both which you should cherish.

I showed her my good side only, my dark side still remains intact, everyone has a dark side. Even with my dark side & even after getting hurt a lot by her words, I can't wish her something bad or unluck, It doesn't feel right to me. I want to forge the hate but...

<br>

I remember her without any reason at unexpected times. I have no hopes of fixing this complicated relationship with her as I won't reach her out even if we both get into the same Uni, if she reaches out then that's awesome, else this remains as a scar. The problem is that this shit pokes me, for example right now it's poking me, that's why I am writing this up. Scar indeed, which I have no way to fix.
