People don't value love, really. They value it when they are in danger, they value it when they know that they can't replace me. The days when I will become the richest man on my blood line are hopefully near, I mean I already started a company which is undercover, I am in dreams of changing this world, sadly in this journey, I leaked some of my emotions to a ruthless person, who doesn't even value if I die? Seriously?

<br>

I lov**ed** someone who didn't value my existance? Dumb bitch, I must say, I have no options. I offered frienship to her, she denied that too, I have no problem with that, I lost nothing, she lost someone which she regrets, I can bet on that. That's good. If she can't compromise her ego then dumping her ass is the only option.

Listen well brothers, never run for girls, NEVER. 90% of the girls are just after your looks, none sees the inner YOU. Build yourself first, then girls are an added bonus. I mean I got asked out by a girl out of nowhere, you have high chances.

<br>

Funnily I showed her my good side only, my dark side still remains intact, so that's good. Time for me to go in exile, I've got a world to change.
