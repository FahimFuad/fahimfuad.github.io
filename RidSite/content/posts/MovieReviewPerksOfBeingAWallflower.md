## The Perks of Being a Wallflower (Drama/Romance) 8/10

You can call this movie a "GoodWatch~ish".<br>

Firstly, I don't watch romance genre, but some quotes from these movie attaracted me, and say what- It was
worth it

This movie is based on a high school dickhead idiot falling in love with his senior (Pretty cringe, but I will allow it because
Emma Watson was there). There is a song "[Could it be another change](https://open.spotify.com/track/50kciHpxC7QyJQujF2LUiF?si=8149eaf9944e484f)"
that I absolutely loved! I gave this movie +2 rating for showing me this song 😛
<br>

Speaking of the ending, it is a BLAST, totally loved it!
<br>

The movie is Worth your time, good watch.

Thank you for reading this post, you are PREETY. 💙
